		<p class="main-title">THE BUSINESS GROWTH BENEFITS<br />OF PARTNERING WITH A1 PERSONAL TRAINING</p>
		<h3 class="title">INCREASED BUZZ</h3>
		<p class="info">It is understood that motivation comes from a positive attitude. That&#8217;s why A1 Personal Training employees bring not only a great program to our partner gyms but also an energy that gets clients moving towards achieving their fitness goals. Activity and energy on the gym floor creates a pleasant atmosphere for all gym members, increasing the likelihood that they will return and recommend your business to others.</p>
		<h3 class="title">ALWAYS A GREAT FIRST IMPRESSION</h3>
		<p class="info">Walk-in clients who are referred to A1 Personal Training get one-on-one attention from an A1 trainer or manager while they are introduced to the gym and the A1 Personal Training program.</p>
		<h3 class="title">REACH A WIDER AUDIENCE</h3>
		<p class="info">A1 Personal Training makes a special effort to reach out to consumers who might otherwise feel intimidated about joining a gym &#8211; those who don&#8217;t exercise regularly, are overweight or have never used a gym before &#8211; getting them first to walk in the door and then to make a commitment to keep coming back.</p>
		<h3 class="title">BIGGER MARKETING EXPOSURE</h3>
		<p class="info">Put your gym&#8217;s name in front of A1 Personal Training&#8217;s target audience: exercisers who might not have considered joining a health club. Get complimentary advertising and marketing exposure, including a direct mail campaign with your business&#8217;s logo, featured placement on a1ptco.com and social media promotion through A1 Personal Training&#8217;s channels.</p>
		<h3 class="title">MEMBER RETENTION</h3>
		<p class="info bottom">Clients who feel welcomed, treated like individuals, included in a positive environment and given the tools to reach their goals are clients who become loyal members.</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>A1 Personal Training will enhance and strengthen your efforts to keep clients coming back by showing your gym as an exciting place to be, rich with workout options and staffed with friendly and professional trainers.</li>
      <li>Personal training clients will enjoy the one-on-one attention of working with a trainer who supports and motivates them so they see their progress and are eager to continue.</li>
      <li>The A1 Personal Training system of creating personalized health and fitness plans makes the gym experience all about the client and their goals, taking away any concern about fitting in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="stat">* There is a common perception that health clubs and gyms do not welcome individuals who are out of shape. Women may also find the strength training areas of gyms intimidating and opt to work out at home. According to statistics taken from IHRSA (International Health &#038; Racquetball Association), only 17.4% of Americans belong to a health club. This leaves a whopping 82.6% of Americans that currently are NOT health club members. It would be safe to say that a good percentage of the population may have negative feelings or apprehension regarding joining a gym and might never take the first step on their own. Therefore this leaves a wide-open market for anyone who can understand how to market to these individuals and understand their mindset.</p>
